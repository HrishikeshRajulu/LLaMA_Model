# LLaMA_Model

## Description
The Llama 2 project is a Python-based application focusing on advanced machine learning models. This project includes scripts for model handling (`Model.py`), data acquisition (`download.sh`), inference mechanisms (`inference.py`), and performance comparison (`mqa_comparison.py`).

## Installation
To set up the Llama 2 project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `download.sh` to download necessary data or models:
   ```bash
   ./download.sh
   ```
3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Usage
- `Model.py`: This script contains the main model architecture. Review or modify it as needed for specific applications.
- `inference.py`: Use this script to run inference using the model. Example usage:
  ```bash
  python inference.py
  ```
- `mqa_comparison.py`: Run this script to compare model quality and performance metrics.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Llama 2 project are welcome. Please follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
